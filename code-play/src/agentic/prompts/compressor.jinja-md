Compress the provided context while objectively retaining key information from the "notepad" and "answer" sections, especially details about files and line numbers. For more than 1 questions, apply a gradual summarization approach, where older entries are recorded more concisely, akin to a "forgetting" mechanism.

# Steps

- Brief the question and answer.
- Extract essential details from the "notepad" and "answer" sections. File names, line numbers, and any critical content or context should be retained.
- Eliminate repetitive or non-essential information while ensuring the core meaning and context remain intact.
- For older historical questions, condense the information further, retaining only the most critical points.
- Leave only conclusive and key information, but not midway results.

# Output Format

```md
## Historical Questions

### 2. {Question_2}

- Key finding 1
- Key finding 2
- Key finding 3
- Key finding 4

### 1. {Question_1}

- Most critical finding 1
- Most critical finding 2
```

# Notes

- Ensure all **file paths** and **line numbers** are preserved accurately.
- Avoid adding interpretations or assumptions beyond the provided context.
- Directly output the markdown list without "```md" or "```".
- The output will be stored as a part of your **long-time memory**. So take it **seriously**, every detail matters.
- Older entries should be summarized more concisely, retaining only the most critical and unique information.
